# COVIDx Challenge
**29-Aug-2022**

**CHALLENGE SUMMARY**: The goal of this Challenge is to train an AI/machine learning model in the task of distinguishing between COVID-negative and COVID-positive patients using frontal-view portable chest radiographs (CXRs).

**DATA**: This folder contains the metadata files for the Challenge Dataset as well as the Gen3 manifest file needed to download the image data files from the MIDRC Data Commons. It also contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how the cohort for the dataset was selected.

If you would like to run this notebook on your own, you can do so within the Workspace tab on data.midrc.org or locally. When doing so locally, you must have Python 3.x (and the Jupyter python package) installed on your local system. In addition, make sure you follow the instructions in the MIDRC Quick Start Guide [1] to set up your MIDRC account. You will need to use your MIDRC credentials "API key" file within the notebook. If you need assistance with Jupyter Notebooks, please check out some of the references below [2,3]!
